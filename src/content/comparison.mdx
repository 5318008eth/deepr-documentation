# Deepr vs. Alternatives

While numerous token launch platforms exist, many suffer from fundamental flaws that lead to poor outcomes for projects and participants. Deepr was designed specifically to address these shortcomings.

## Limitations of Current Launchpads (Pump.fun Case Study)

Platforms like Pump.fun, despite their popularity, often exemplify the common pitfalls:

-   **Rampant Rug Pulls:** The ease of launch combined with flawed mechanics leads to a high percentage of projects quickly collapsing.
-   **Extreme Volatility:** Shallow initial liquidity makes prices incredibly sensitive to small trades.
-   **Bot Dominance:** Lack of robust anti-MEV and anti-snipe protection allows bots to exploit launches.
-   **Whale Bundling:** Often, the entire supply can be bought up instantly, preventing fair distribution.

<Callout type="warning">
  **Real-world evidence from Pump.fun:**
  - Total coins bonded: **87,170**
  - Only **4 coins** reached >$100m market cap (0.005%): $fartcoin, $arc, $ACT, $pnut
  - Only **40 coins** reached >$10m market cap (0.05%)
  - Only **250 coins** reached >$1m market cap (0.3%)
  - **79,000 coins** (90.6%) ended with <$100k market cap = likely complete rugs!
</Callout>

These statistics highlight the systemic failure of models that don't adequately protect against manipulation and ensure sustainable liquidity.

## Price Impact Comparison

One of the most significant advantages of Deepr's [Smart Liquidity Scaling](../core-concepts/smart-liquidity) is its ability to mitigate the severe price drops seen on other platforms when tokens are sold. The following table illustrates the estimated difference in price impact when 3% of the total supply is sold at various market caps:

**(Based on $2500 ETH and $144 SOL estimates used in original onepager)**

| Market Cap (FDV) | Pump.fun Price Drop | Deepr.fun Price Drop | Advantage                 |
| :--------------- | :------------------ | :------------------- | :------------------------ |
| $100k            | 30.0%               | 27.5%                | <span className="advantage">1.1x less impact</span> |
| $500k            | 51.6%               | 39.5%                | <span className="advantage">1.3x less impact</span> |
| $2M              | 71.5%               | 49.8%                | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |
| $5M              | 82.3%               | 60.4%                | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |

As the market cap grows, Deepr's automatically scaling liquidity provides significantly better price stability compared to models with fixed, shallow initial liquidity.

## The Deepr Advantage: Summary

Deepr combines several key innovations to create a demonstrably fairer and more sustainable launch environment:

1.  **No Initial Supply Bundling:** [Progressive Supply Release](../core-concepts/progressive-supply) makes it impossible to acquire the entire supply at launch.
2.  **Bot & Snipe Resistance:** The [Priority Fee Cap and Purchase Limits](../core-concepts/anti-manipulation) deter MEV bots and prevent large initial snipes.
3.  **Reduced Volatility:** [Smart Liquidity Scaling](../core-concepts/smart-liquidity) automatically deepens the pool as the token grows, dampening price impact.
4.  **Fairer Distribution:** Supply is released across different price points and initial purchases are capped, promoting wider ownership.
5.  **Ecosystem Value:** Fees generated benefit the project deployer and accrue value to the native [$DEEPR Token](../deepr-token) holders and the Deepr Vault.

By addressing the core issues of manipulation, distribution, and liquidity head-on, Deepr offers a superior alternative for launching tokens with a focus on fairness and long-term viability.
