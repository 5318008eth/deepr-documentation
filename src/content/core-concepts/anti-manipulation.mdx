# Anti-Manipulation Mechanisms

Token launches are prime targets for manipulative actors using bots for front-running, sandwich attacks, and sniping the initial supply. Deepr incorporates several layers of protection directly into its smart contracts to create a fairer trading environment.

## Protecting Against Bots & Sniping

Deepr combines two primary mechanisms to deter common manipulation tactics:

1.  **Priority Fee Cap:** Limits the effectiveness of MEV bots that rely on high gas fees.
2.  **Purchase Limits Per Tranche:** Prevents single wallets from acquiring excessive amounts of tokens, especially in early stages.

These work in conjunction with the [Progressive Supply Release](./progressive-supply) to provide robust protection.

## Priority Fee Cap Explained

MEV bots often gain an advantage by paying extremely high priority gas fees to get their transactions ordered favourably within a block (e.g., front-running a large buy or sandwiching a swap).

Deepr implements a `maxPriorityFee` check (currently set at **5 gwei**) within its contract functions:

- **Tranche Purchases:** The `buyInitialTranche` and `buyTranche` functions revert if the transaction's priority fee (`tx.gasprice - block.basefee`) exceeds this limit.
- **DEX Swaps:** The contract overrides the standard ERC20 `_update` function (which is called during transfers, including those to/from the DEX pair). This override *also* enforces the `maxPriorityFee` check whenever tokens are transferred to or from the associated Uniswap V2 pair address.

**Impact:**

- **Deters Front-running/Sandwiching:** Bots cannot simply outbid regular users with exorbitant gas fees to execute these attacks.
- **Levels the Playing Field:** Legitimate users paying normal priority fees are not disadvantaged.
- **Doesn't Block Normal Trading:** The cap is high enough not to interfere with standard transactions during normal network conditions but low enough to price out common MEV strategies.

## Purchase Limits Per Tranche

To prevent individual wallets (potentially controlled by whales or sophisticated bots) from sniping large portions of the supply as tranches become available, Deepr enforces per-wallet purchase limits specific to each tranche:

- **Tranches 0-2:** Max purchase per wallet is limited to **5%** of that specific tranche's supply.
- **Tranches 3-5:** Limit increases to **10%** per wallet.
- **Tranches 6-8:** Limit increases to **20%** per wallet.
- **Tranches 9-13:** Purchase limits are removed (allowing wallets to buy the entire remaining amount of these smaller, later tranches).

**Impact:**

- **Prevents Early Snipes:** Ensures a wider distribution during the critical initial phases.
- **Gradual Relaxation:** Allows for larger accumulation as the token matures and market cap grows, aligning with natural market dynamics.
- **Complements Supply Release:** Works hand-in-hand with the tranche system to force distribution over time and price levels.

## Balancing Protection and Price Discovery

Deepr aims to protect launches without unduly restricting legitimate trading or price discovery.

- The priority fee cap targets manipulative *gas bidding*, not the size or frequency of trades themselves.
- Purchase limits are *per tranche* and gradually relax, allowing organic accumulation over time.
- Natural price momentum driven by genuine demand is still possible and encouraged.

By implementing these targeted protections, Deepr fosters an environment where price can move based on real market activity, significantly reducing the impact of common exploits that plague traditional launch platforms.
