# The Native Deepr Token ($DEEPR)

$DEEPR is the native utility and governance token of the Deepr.fun platform. While Deepr enables the launch of many different tokens using its template, the $DEEPR token itself plays a central role in the ecosystem's value flow and future direction.

## Role in the Ecosystem

The primary functions of the $DEEPR token include:

-   **Value Accrual:** Capturing a portion of the value generated by successful launches on the platform.
-   **Reward Distribution:** Enabling rewards for token holders through mechanisms like airdrops.
-   **Governance (Future):** Potentially enabling holders to participate in decisions regarding the platform's development, feature prioritization, and fee structures.

## Value Accrual: Fee Distribution Explained

Every token launched using the `DeeprTemplate` contract contributes to the Deepr ecosystem through its fee mechanism, which directly benefits $DEEPR holders and the platform's treasury.

When liquidity is added to a token's pool (both during the initial deployment after Tranche 0 sells out, and during subsequent purchases from Tranches 1-13), a **10% fee** is applied to *both* the ETH and the Tokens being paired:

1.  **ETH Fee (10% of ETH portion):** This fee is split:
    *   **75%** goes to the **Project Deployer** (the wallet that launched that specific token).
    *   **25%** goes to the **Deepr Vault** (`DEEPR_VAULT` address).

2.  **Token Fee (10% of Token portion):** This fee represents 5% of the total tokens involved in the tranche purchase/sale event.
    *   **100%** of this token fee goes to the **Deepr Airdrop** (`DEEPR_AIRDROP` address).

<Callout type="info">
  **Example:** If a purchase from Tranche 2 adds 1 ETH and 1,000,000 Project Tokens to liquidity:
  - **ETH Fee:** 0.1 ETH is taken. 0.075 ETH goes to the Project Deployer, 0.025 ETH goes to the Deepr Vault.
  - **Token Fee:** 100,000 Project Tokens are taken (10% of the LP portion). All 100,000 tokens go to the Deepr Airdrop address.
  - **Liquidity Added:** 0.9 ETH is paired with 900,000 Project Tokens in the LP pool.

## Deepr Vault & Airdrop Mechanism

These two dedicated addresses are crucial for ecosystem health:

-   **`DEEPR_VAULT`:** Accumulates the 25% share of the ETH fees from *all* launches on Deepr. These funds serve as the platform's treasury and may be used for various purposes, including:
    -   Funding platform development and operations.
    -   Marketing and ecosystem growth initiatives.
    -   Potential buy-backs and burns of the native $DEEPR token to enhance its value.

-   **`DEEPR_AIRDROP`:** Accumulates the token fees (effectively 5% of the supply sold/paired) from *all* launches on Deepr. This address serves as the source for distributing rewards back to the community, primarily:
    -   Airdropping various project tokens launched on Deepr to holders of the native $DEEPR token.

This mechanism ensures that $DEEPR holders directly benefit from the activity and success of the entire platform.

## Token Generation Event (TGE) & Initial Distribution

-   **TGE:** The $DEEPR token itself will be launched using the `DeeprTemplate` contract after the mainnet platform launch and successful testing phases.
-   **Initial Distribution via Airdrop:** To reward early supporters, the initial circulating supply of $DEEPR will be distributed via airdrop to holders of the previous project token, $BOOB.
    -   Following the deployment of the $DEEPR token contract, the Deepr team will initiate the launch sequence by purchasing the entire Tranche 0 supply (22% of total $DEEPR supply).
    -   This purchase triggers the automatic pairing of another 22% of the $DEEPR supply for the initial liquidity pool.
    -   The Deepr team will then airdrop **all** tokens acquired during this initial phase (Tranche 0 purchase + the paired LP tokens, totaling 44% of the $DEEPR supply) to eligible $BOOB token holders based on a snapshot taken prior to the $DEEPR launch.

<Callout type="warning">
  Specific details regarding the $BOOB snapshot criteria (e.g., date, time, minimum holding) and the airdrop claim process will be announced closer to the $DEEPR TGE through official Deepr channels.

This initial distribution method ensures a fair launch for $DEEPR itself, leveraging the Deepr contract mechanics while rewarding the foundational community.
