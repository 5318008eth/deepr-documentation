  # Deepr.fun
  The Evolution of Fair Token Launches
</div>

## The Problem

Current token launches are broken:

- Entire supply can be bundled at launch by whales
- Bots and MEV exploit every transaction  
- Price crashes on small sells due to poor liquidity
- High initial liquidity requirements price out most projects

<Callout type="warning">
### Real-world evidence from Pump.fun:

- Total coins bonded: **87,170**
- Only **4 coins** reached {'>'}\$100m market cap (0.005%): \$fartcoin, \$arc, \$ACT, \$pnut
- Only **40 coins** reached {'>'}\$10m market cap (0.05%)
- Only **250 coins** reached {'>'}\$1m market cap (0.3%)
- **79,000 coins** (90.6%) ended with {'<'}\$100k market cap = complete rugs!
</Callout>

## The Solution

Deepr.fun revolutionizes token launches with:

<div className="feature-list">
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Progressive Supply Release
    Prevents whales from bundling the entire supply at launch
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Advanced Anti-Bot Protections
    Blocks harmful MEV exploitation and front-running
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Enhanced Liquidity Scaling
    Automatically increases as market cap grows
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Low Barrier to Entry
    With growing protection mechanisms as projects mature
  </div>
</div>

## The Platform

- Full-featured token deployer
- Built-in swap interface routes to the best price (uniswap vs tranche)
- Enhanced progressive liquidity system
- Launching on Base for optimal accessibility

## The Token

- TGE after testnet launch
- Holders receive airdrops from all future Deepr.fun launches
- A portion of all future launch fees will be used to buy back and burn the token
- Fair launch with no pre-mine

## Smart Liquidity Design

### Best of Both Worlds

<Callout>
**Starts with lower liquidity allowing for:**

- Lower launch costs
- Faster price appreciation
- More accessible launch requirements
- Quick price discovery

**As market cap grows:**

- Liquidity automatically scales up
- Price stability increases
- Manipulation becomes harder
- Slippage fees decrease

**Result:** Early price action of a low-cap gem with the stability of a mature token

## Price Impact Protection
(based on $2500 ETH and $144 SOL)

When someone sells 3% of supply:

| Market Cap | Pump.fun | Deepr.fun | Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| $100k FDV | 30.0% price drop | 27.5% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.1x less impact</span> |
| $500k FDV | 51.6% price drop | 39.5% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.3x less impact</span> |
| $2M FDV | 71.5% price drop | 49.8% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |
| $5M FDV | 82.3% price drop | 60.4% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |

## Protected Token Distribution

### Initial Supply Protection
- Only 22% of supply available in initial tranche sale is paired with 22% of supply as liquidity
- Remaining 56% of supply is locked in 13 progressive tranches
- Each tranche only unlocks when price reaches specific levels
- Makes it impossible to bundle the entire supply at launch
- Forces distribution across different price points

### Purchase Limits By Tranche
- Initial tranche: Limited to prevent single-buyer dominance
- Middle tranches: 5-20% limits per wallet
- Later tranches: Gradually increasing limits
- Result: No single entity can control the supply

## Advanced Anti-Sniping Protection

### Transaction Protection
- Maximum priority fee of 5 gwei blocks sandwich attacks and front-running
- Legitimate buyers can still accumulate normally
- No artificial caps on position size - just protection from manipulation tactics
- Natural price movement remains possible while bots get blocked

### Progressive Price Discovery
- 14 separate tranches unlock at progressively higher prices
- Each tranche can be accessed once its price level is reached
- No artificial barriers to upward price movement
- Creates natural buying pressure as new tranches become available

## The Deepr.fun Advantage

<div className="advantage-grid">
  <div className="advantage-section">
    <h3>How It Enables Fair Growth</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Supply Protection</strong>: Impossible to bundle all tokens at launch</li>
      <li><strong>Equal Access</strong>: Every buyer gets the same opportunity at each price level</li>
      <li><strong>No Bot Advantage</strong>: Bots can't front-run or manipulate gas prices</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Momentum</strong>: Price can still move quickly when genuine demand exists</li>
      <li><strong>Protected Discovery</strong>: Price finds its level through real market activity</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div className="advantage-section">
    <h3>Protection Without Restriction</h3>
    <p>Traditional launches force you to choose between:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having entire supply bundled by whales</li>
      <li>Getting sniped by bots</li>
      <li>Having artificial limits that kill momentum</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Deepr.fun solves this by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distributing supply across price levels</li>
      <li>Blocking harmful bot activity</li>
      <li>Allowing natural price discovery</li>
      <li>Enabling legitimate accumulation</li>
      <li>Supporting organic growth patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## The Result

A token that can still experience significant price appreciation when genuine demand exists, but without:
- Supply getting bundled at launch
- Getting instantly sniped
- Being manipulated by MEV bots
- Suffering from sandwich attacks
- Having artificial growth restrictions

This creates an environment where price can move naturally while maintaining protection from the harmful elements that typically destroy token launches. The combination of progressive supply release, anti-sniping measures, and price impact protection creates the fairest and most sustainable launch mechanism available in the market today.
