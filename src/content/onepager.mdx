  # Deepr.fun
  The Evolution of Fair Token Launches
</div>

## The Problem

Current token launches are broken:

- Entire supply can be bundled at launch by whales
- Bots and MEV exploit every transaction  
- Price crashes on small sells due to poor liquidity
- High initial liquidity requirements price out most projects

<Callout type="warning">
### Real-world evidence from Pump.fun:

- Total coins bonded: **87,170**
- Only **4 coins** reached {'>'}\$100m market cap (0.005%): \$fartcoin, \$arc, \$ACT, \$pnut
- Only **40 coins** reached {'>'}\$10m market cap (0.05%)
- Only **250 coins** reached {'>'}\$1m market cap (0.3%)
- **79,000 coins** (90.6%) ended with {'<'}\$100k market cap = complete rugs!
</Callout>

## The Solution

Deepr.fun revolutionizes token launches with:

<div className="feature-list">
  <div className="feature-item">

  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Advanced Anti-Bot Protections
    Blocks harmful MEV exploitation and front-running
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Enhanced Liquidity Scaling
    Automatically increases as market cap grows
  </div>
  <div className="feature-item">
    ### Low Barrier to Entry
    With growing protection mechanisms as projects mature
  </div>
</div>

## The Platform

- Full-featured token deployer
- Built-in swap interface routes to the best price (uniswap vs tranche)
- Enhanced progressive liquidity system
- Launching on Base for optimal accessibility

## The Token

- TGE after testnet launch
- **Fee Structure:** When liquidity is added (initial deployment & tranche buys 1-13), a 10% fee is applied to both the ETH and Tokens being paired:
  - **ETH Fee (10%):** 75% is sent to the project deployer, 25% to the Deepr Vault.
  - **Token Fee (10% of LP tokens = 5% of total tranche tokens):** 100% is sent to the Deepr Airdrop address.
- Holders of the native Deepr token receive rewards sourced from the Deepr Airdrop address (accruing value from all launches on the platform).
- The Deepr Vault may use collected ETH for ecosystem initiatives, including potential buy-backs/burns of the native Deepr token.
- Deployed with no team allocation for *this* token; initial supply is held by the contract for the launch mechanism.

## Smart Liquidity Design

### Best of Both Worlds

<Callout>
**Starts with lower liquidity allowing for:**

- Lower launch costs
- Faster price appreciation
- More accessible launch requirements
- Quick price discovery

**As market cap grows:**

- Liquidity automatically scales up
- Price stability increases
- Manipulation becomes harder
- Slippage fees decrease

**Result:** Early price action of a low-cap gem with the stability of a mature token

## Price Impact Protection
(based on $2500 ETH and $144 SOL)

When someone sells 3% of supply:

| Market Cap | Pump.fun | Deepr.fun | Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| $100k FDV | 30.0% price drop | 27.5% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.1x less impact</span> |
| $500k FDV | 51.6% price drop | 39.5% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.3x less impact</span> |
| $2M FDV | 71.5% price drop | 49.8% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |
| $5M FDV | 82.3% price drop | 60.4% price drop | <span className="advantage">1.4x less impact</span> |

## Protected Token Distribution

### Initial Supply Protection
- Only 22% of supply is sold in the initial tranche, paired with another 22% of supply as initial liquidity.
- Remaining 56% of supply is controlled by the contract: 28% is locked in 13 progressive tranches, and 28% remains held by the contract for future use or governance.
- Each tranche only unlocks when the market price reaches specific levels defined in the contract.
- Makes it impossible for whales to bundle the entire supply at launch.
- Forces distribution across different price points as the token matures.

### Purchase Limits By Tranche
- **Initial Tranches (0-2):** Max purchase limited to 5% of the tranche supply per wallet.
- **Middle Tranches (3-5):** Limit increases to 10% per wallet.
- **Upper-Middle Tranches (6-8):** Limit increases to 20% per wallet.
- **Later Tranches (9-13):** Limits removed (relative to tranche size).
- Result: Prevents single-entity dominance while allowing larger buys as the market matures.

## Advanced Anti-Sniping Protection

### Transaction Protection
- **Priority Fee Cap:** A maximum priority fee (currently 5 gwei) applies to tranche buys *and* DEX swaps, blocking common sandwich attacks and front-running bots.
- **Purchase Limits:** Per-tranche wallet limits (see above) further prevent large initial snipes.
- Legitimate buyers can still accumulate normally within limits.
- Natural price movement remains possible while manipulative bots are significantly hindered.

## The Deepr.fun Advantage

<div className="advantage-grid">
  <div className="advantage-section">
    <h3>How It Enables Fair Growth</h3>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Supply Protection</strong>: Impossible to bundle all tokens at launch</li>
      <li><strong>Equal Access</strong>: Every buyer gets the same opportunity at each price level</li>
      <li><strong>No Bot Advantage</strong>: Bots can't front-run or manipulate gas prices</li>
      <li><strong>Natural Momentum</strong>: Price can still move quickly when genuine demand exists</li>
      <li><strong>Protected Discovery</strong>: Price finds its level through real market activity</li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <div className="advantage-section">
    <h3>Protection Without Restriction</h3>
    <p>Traditional launches force you to choose between:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having entire supply bundled by whales</li>
      <li>Getting sniped by MEV bots</li>
      <li>Having artificial global limits that kill momentum</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Deepr.fun solves this by:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Distributing supply across price levels (Tranches)</li>
      <li>Blocking harmful bot activity (Priority Fee Cap)</li>
      <li>Implementing wallet limits per tranche (fair access)</li>
      <li>Allowing natural price discovery</li>
      <li>Enabling legitimate accumulation</li>
      <li>Supporting organic growth patterns</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>

## The Result

A token launch mechanism designed for fair participation and sustainable growth:
- Initial supply cannot be bundled at launch (Tranche 0 + LP).
- MEV bots are deterred (Priority Fee Cap on buys & swaps).
- Early snipes are limited (Tranche purchase caps).
- Price discovers its level through genuine demand across tranches.
- Liquidity scales naturally with market cap growth.

This creates an environment where price can move naturally while maintaining protection from the harmful elements that typically destroy token launches. The combination of progressive supply release, anti-sniping measures (fee caps + purchase limits), and scaled liquidity protection creates the fairest and most sustainable launch mechanism available.
